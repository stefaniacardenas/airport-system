#Airport System
==================

This is my third week project at Makers Academy. 
The Airport System allows you to control the flow of planes of an airport.
The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. 

How it works
-----------

I will use random number generator to set the weather (it is normally sunny but on rare occasions it may be stormy). I will probably use (if I work out how to do that) a double to override random weather. Finally, every plane will have a status indicating whether it's flying or landed.
